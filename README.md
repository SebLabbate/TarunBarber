A freelance web development project for a local barber shop. 

This project is built with Ruby on Rails using HTML, CSS & JS (STIMULUS). 

I have chosen to work on this project solo to gain experience working on a project from start to finish by myself. This is to ensure I fully understand the development process, and get used to debugging / problem solving myself. 

If you have an suggestions for improvements please let me know!
